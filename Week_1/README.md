JVC2 Week_1
====

Prototypes and Closures

	This first week focuses on fundemantals of Javascript, these are the most basic of tools used within the language,
	frameworks, and in application development. "Vanilla JS" is a term used to describe scripts written in language
	basics without the use of any library or framework. These two principle concepts in 'functional javascript' allows
	the reader to understand how more complex applications are built and how it scales in size, but more importantly
	how the breakdown occurs and the interfaces to use methods.
